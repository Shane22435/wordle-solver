# Usage

this solver is designed to both create and solve a worldle problem on its own, it will then return the average number of guesses based on the number of iterations and how many guesses it took to solve the proble

- to run more simulations simply change the number in the loop at the bottom of solver.py
- right now there is no option to create a puzzle and play it yourself, this will be added at a later date
